# Spatial-Temporal-Traffic-Prediction

This repository corresponds to the implementation of spatial-temporal prediction of traffic flow. We were awarded the eighth place in the China College Student Transportation Big Data Competition.

The structure of this repository is as follows:

1. data_analysis.ipynb/floating-car.ipynb: We analyzed the characteristics of traffic flow and high frequency floating car data in these two files.
2. arima.ipynb: ARIMA model implementation.
3. wavelet-lstm.ipynb: Using Wavelet Transform to improve the performance of lstm.
4. spatial-temporal-forecast.ipynb: Implementation of CNN_LSTM model to forecast traffic flow.
